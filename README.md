# Mixamo-To-Godot
This is a Blender 2.9 script for importing mixamo Models to Godot-3
 
The script does the following things 
1) Imports the mixamo models from the folder you specify.
2) Adds a root motion bone to the skeleton.
3) Renames the skeleton to godot appropriate conventions.
4) Creates NLA tracks fdor each action.

There are a few bugs but overall it works very well to quickly protrytpe a 3d Godot game.
